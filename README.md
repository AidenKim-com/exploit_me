# exploit_me
Very vulnerable ARM application (CTF style exploitation tutorial for ARM, but portable to other platforms)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Why:
----
Some of my friends asked me if I could do some examples
of exploitable stuff I've seen in real-world the past years for ARM/others.

So, for training purposes, I thought: Why not :)

Installation (just recommended setup, not needed for exploitation):
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  ```sudo pip install capstone``` for python 2.x
  or
  ```sudo pip3 install capstone``` for python 3.x

Use either "python" or "pip" for python 2.x
or "python3" or "pip3" accordingly for python 3.x

1. Basic install (tested with Ubuntu 17.10 64Bit)
   ```
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install gdb-multiarch
    $ sudo apt-get install python2.7 python-pip python-dev git libssl-dev libffi-dev build-essential
    $ pip install --upgrade capstone
    $ sudo apt-get install qemu-system-arm
   ```

2. Install pwndbg:
   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg
   $ cd pwndbg && python setup.py install && cd ..
   ```

3. Install ROPgadget:
   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/ROPgadget
   $ cd ROPgadget && python setup.py install && cd ..
   ```

4. Install pwntools:
   ```
   $ pip install --upgrade pip
   $ pip install --upgrade pwntools
   ```

5. Install cross compilers (only needed if you want to add stuff or port to other platforms):
   ```
   $ sudo apt-get install libc6-armel-cross libc6-dev-armel-cross
   $ sudo apt-get install binutils-arm-linux-gnueabi
   $ sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev
   $ sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi
   $ sudo apt-get install g++-arm-linux-gnueabi
   ```
- For cross-compiling the code for ARM:
  ```
   $ arm-linux-gnueabi-g++ -fno-stack-protector exploit.cpp -o exploit
  ```
  (Remove -fno-stack-protector for more fun)


Usage:
------
- For trying if it works :
  "qemu-arm-static -L /usr/arm-linux-gnueabi/ ./exploit"

- Example debugging session:
  ```
  $ sudo ./disableaslr.sh
  $ mkdir -p dir1/dir2
  ```
  (Disable aslr, don't run if you want more fun)
  (dir1/dir2 needed in current exploit directory for Path Traversal vulnerability)
  
  In first terminal:
  ------------------
  ```
  $ qemu-arm-static -L /usr/arm-linux-gnueabi/ -g 1234 ./exploit [levelpassword] [options]
  ```

  Add this to .gdbinit in home directory:
  ```
  set auto-load safe-path /
  ```

  In second terminal (make sure .gdbinit is in the same directory):
  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  ```
  $ gdb-multiarch ./exploit
  ```

- GDB Basics: Use "si" to step into functions or "so" to step over functions, "info functions" to print all functions, "b [function]" (Example: "b main" to set a breakpoint and "b *0x1234" to set a breakpoint at addr 0x1234, "c" to continue program, "x/[dwords]x" to print offsets, for example "x/4x 0x1234" and "x/[dwords]x $reg" to print register contents, for example "x/4x $sp". Using pwndbg, you can use "rop" to list rop gadgets, for example "rop --grep 'pop {r3'" to list gadgets which pop values from stack to r3. See https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/blob/dev/FEATURES.md for more details !

- After you've exploited correctly, you will see the password for the next level
  So if level2 password would be "Level2":
  ```
  $ qemu-arm-static -L /usr/arm-linux-gnueabi/ ./exploit Level2
  ```

- For cheaters or people trying to understand with less instruction knowledge :
  See solution and source code in exploit.cpp

- There are more solutions possible, even with rop chains, not just mine

- There are some hints printed to console (information leak), which you normally wouldn't have, but these make things easier for beginners, that's why I added it

My .gdbinit setup:
------------------
```
set endian little
set architecture arm
target remote :1234
```

Current vulnerabilities:
------------------------
```
Level 1: Integer overflow
Level 2: Stack overflow
Level 3: Array overflow
Level 4: Off by one
Level 5: Stack cookie
Level 6: Format string
Level 7: Heap overflow
Level 8: Structure redirection / Type confusion
Level 9: Zero pointers
Level 10: Command injection
Level 11: Path Traversal
```

ToDo:
-----
- Will add other vulnerabilities as I see them or have spare time (multi-thread and use-after-free vulnerabilities missing will follow soon)
- Port to ARM64
